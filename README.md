# Assignment instructions

- Build a kanban board like in [https://minimals.cc/dashboard/kanban](https://minimals.cc/dashboard/kanban) (This is just for the looks not the functionality)
  - This is just an example of how this could look like. There are many unneccesary features.
- For drag and drop you can use `@dnd-kit/core` ([https://docs.dndkit.com/](https://docs.dndkit.com/))
- Drag and drop is a must have
- Structure the current state of the columns and cards so that they could be stored in a document (NoSQL store) (actual saving and retrieving is not required)
  <br>
  <br>

# Requirements

- Add a new Card to a column
- Drag a card to another column
- Sorting cards should also work
- Changing Card or Column title is NOT required
- Deleting a Card is NOT required
- Showing images is a nice to have but is not required
